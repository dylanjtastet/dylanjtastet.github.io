### Can I bring a date or my kids? 

Our wedding will be an intimate one, and our venue can only accommodate so many people. Only those whose names are on the invitation will be able to join us. Unfortunately we are not able to accommodate plus ones. 


### What should I wear?

Our dress code is cocktail attire. Please wear clothes you are comfortable in! The wedding will be outdoors in Fearringtonâ€™s beautiful English-inspired gardens. In mid-May, the temperature tends to range from the low to high 70s throughout the day, although this of course may vary. 

### How should I get there?

There is parking at the venue. We recommend driving or carpooling with someone. Uber/Lyft is also an option, although please consider that rideshare options may not be as plentiful as they are in larger towns like Raleigh, Cary, and Chapel Hill.

### Where can I RSVP?

Formal invitations will be mailed to your home address soon. The invitation will include information on how to RSVP. Please fill out the form linked in the save the date (which you can also find [here](https://www.postable.com/tastetmcdarriswedding)) so that we can ensure that your invitation reaches you.
